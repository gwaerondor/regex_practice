=== Regex practice ===

This repository consists mostly of scripts that contain exercises
for learning or practicing regular expressions.

I have tried making them as straightforward as possible.

To read the instructions for an exercise, run the script without any input arguments.
Example:

bash 01_simple_letter.bash

Instructions will be printed out in the terminal.
The tests that will be run in order to decide if the exercise has been successfully
completed is also printed to the terminal.

To submit an answer for an exercise, run the script with a regular expression
as the input argument. The regex will be run with each of the test cases.

For any failed test cases, the expected matches will be printed out together
with the actual matches. Modifications to the regex can be done before submitting again.

The exercises can be done in any order, though the idea is that the difficulty will
be progressively increasing in later exercises.

Enjoy!
